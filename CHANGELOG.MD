✅ **Dummy Data Setup**: Created "Rand" property with 4 attached documents and 2 chat sessions

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Backend**: New Property model with CRUD API endpoints (`/properties/*`)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper foreign keys and cascading deletes
- **Frontend**: PropertySelector and PropertyCreateModal React components
- **State Management**: Property selection triggers document/chat filtering
- **Data Migration**: Existing documents and chats attached to default "Rand" property
- **API Endpoints**: Complete property management with document assignment
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing dashboard layout

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE properties (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR,
    street_address VARCHAR,
    city VARCHAR,
    zip_code VARCHAR,
    description TEXT,
    owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN property_id INTEGER REFERENCES properties(id);
ALTER TABLE chat_sessions ADD COLUMN property_id INTEGER REFERENCES properties(id);
```

### 2025-09-26 - Authentication & Property Selection Fixes

✅ **Authentication Token Management**: Fixed "Loading failed: No authentication token" errors
✅ **Default Property Selection**: Automatic property selection on login for better UX
✅ **Property-Based Document Filtering**: Documents now filter correctly by selected property
✅ **Session Persistence**: Property selection persists across screens and browser sessions
✅ **Centralized State Management**: Created PropertyContext for consistent property handling
✅ **Cross-Screen Consistency**: Property selection maintained when navigating between dashboard, chat, and other screens

**Issues Fixed:**

- **Authentication Errors**: Components were using `localStorage.getItem("token")` directly instead of AuthContext
- **No Default Selection**: Users had no property selected after login, causing confusion
- **Document Filtering**: Document list didn't change when switching between properties
- **Session Loss**: Property selection was lost when navigating between screens

**Technical Implementation:**

- **PropertyContext**: New React context (`frontend/context/PropertyContext.tsx`) for centralized property management
- **Session Storage**: User-specific property selection stored as `selectedPropertyId_{userId}`
- **Auto-Selection Logic**: Automatically selects first available property on login
- **Token Centralization**: All components now use `useAuth()` hook instead of direct localStorage access
- **Component Updates**: Updated Dashboard, PropertySelector, SelectedPropertyBox, and DocumentsList
- **Performance Optimization**: Used `useCallback` for optimized re-rendering

**API Endpoints Used:**

- `GET /properties` - Fetch user's properties
- `GET /documents` - All documents (when "All Properties" selected)
- `GET /properties/{id}/documents` - Property-specific documents
- `GET /properties/{id}` - Individual property details

**State Management Flow:**

1. User logs in → PropertyContext loads properties
2. First property auto-selected if none stored in session
3. Property selection triggers document filtering
4. Selection persists in sessionStorage with user-specific key
5. Navigation between screens maintains selected property
6. Logout clears all property state
