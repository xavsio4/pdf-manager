# Chat Context Preservation Fix

## Problem Solved

Fixed the issue where chat conversations lost context between messages. Previously, when users asked follow-up questions like "On which page?" after asking about a specific document, the AI would search for new documents instead of maintaining context from the previous conversation.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Backend API (`backend/app/main.py`)

- **Added conversation history retrieval**: Now fetches the last 10 messages from the current chat session
- **Implemented contextual search**: Combines current question with recent conversation history for better document relevance
- **Enhanced message processing**: Passes conversation history to AI services

### 2. AI Service (`backend/app/services/ai_service.py`)

- **Updated `generate_ai_response` method**: Now accepts `conversation_history` parameter
- **Enhanced OpenAI integration**: Includes previous conversation in prompts for better context awareness
- **Improved prompt engineering**: AI now explicitly instructed to use both document context AND conversation history

### 3. Ollama Service (`backend/app/services/ollama_service.py`)

- **Added conversation history support**: Local AI models now receive conversation context
- **Updated prompt templates**: Includes previous messages for consistent responses
- **Enhanced system prompts**: Better instructions for handling conversational context

## How It Works

### Before the Fix:

1. User asks: "Comment désactiver le signal acoustique de fin de programme?"
2. AI finds and references Candy document ✅
3. User asks: "On which page?"
4. AI searches only for "On which page?" and finds different documents ❌

### After the Fix:

1. User asks: "Comment désactiver le signal acoustique de fin de programme?"
2. AI finds and references Candy document ✅
3. User asks: "On which page?"
4. AI searches with context: "Previous conversation: [previous messages] Current question: On which page?"
5. AI maintains reference to Candy document and provides page information ✅

## Technical Implementation

### Contextual Search Query

```python
# Build contextual query including recent conversation
if recent_messages:
    conversation_context = "\n".join([
        f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}" for msg in recent_messages[-5:]
    ])
    contextual_query = f"Previous conversation:\n{conversation_context}\n\nCurrent question: {user_message}"
    similar_chunks = ai_service.search_similar_content(db, current_user.id, contextual_query, limit=5)
```

### Enhanced AI Prompts

```python
# Include conversation context in AI prompt
conversation_context = ""
if conversation_history:
    conversation_context = "\n\nPrevious conversation:\n"
    for msg in conversation_history[-5:]:
        conversation_context += f"{msg.role.title()}: {msg.content}\n"

prompt = f"""Answer based on provided context and previous conversation.
Context: {context}
{conversation_context}
Current question: {query}"""
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Document Reference Continuity

1. Start a new chat session
2. Ask: "Comment désactiver le signal acoustique de fin de programme?"
3. Verify AI references Candy document
4. Ask: "On which page?"
5. Verify AI still references Candy document and provides page information

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-turn Conversation

1. Ask about a specific document feature
2. Ask follow-up questions using pronouns ("it", "this", "that")
3. Verify AI maintains context throughout the conversation

### Test Scenario 3: Document Switching

1. Ask about Document A
2. Ask about Document B
3. Ask "What was the difference between the two?"
4. Verify AI references both documents correctly

## Benefits

1. **Natural Conversations**: Users can ask follow-up questions naturally
2. **Consistent References**: AI maintains document context throughout conversations
3. **Better User Experience**: No need to repeat context in every message
4. **Improved Accuracy**: Contextual search finds more relevant information
5. **Works with All AI Models**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, and local Ollama models

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The fix works automatically with:

- **Local AI**: DeepSeek R1, Llama, Mistral models via Ollama
- **Cloud AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude
- **Hybrid Setup**: Automatic fallback from local to cloud AI

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Only stores last 10 messages in memory
- **Efficient search**: Contextual queries improve relevance without significant cost
- **Smart limiting**: Uses only last 5 messages for AI context to avoid token limits

## Commit Details

**Commit Hash**: `f50cfa5`
**Files Changed**: 28 files
**Key Changes**:

- `backend/app/main.py`: Chat message processing with history
- `backend/app/services/ai_service.py`: Enhanced AI response generation
- `backend/app/services/ollama_service.py`: Local AI context support

This fix ensures that your PDF manager's chat system now behaves like a proper conversational AI, maintaining context and providing consistent, relevant responses throughout multi-turn conversations.
